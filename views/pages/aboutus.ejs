    <p class="aboutUs1">My name is Austin Smith.
      I enjoy fishing, snowboarding and reading when I'm not sitting in front of a computer.
      My inspiration for software development was spurred by a desire to create something out of nothing.
      I hope to one day use my experiences from CodeFellows to program robotic prostheses.</p>

      last 6 years I have been working supply chain distribution. I gotten in to coding after taking a 101 class at Code
      Fellows and I have been hooked ever since. My goal is after completing Code Fellows is to land a my first job as a
      coder and began my new career. </p>

    <p class="aboutUs1">Hi, my name is Natalie. I currently work for Tesla and as a “software company that decided to build a car” I work a lot

    <p class="aboutUs1">Hi, my name is Lesley. I'm An adventurous introvert pursuing my passion for code. I'm happily married and mother of two handsome, full of energy boys. When I'm not stuck on my computer coding I'm out hiking, trying new places to eat, or in my garage getting my CrossFit on.</p>
    <p class="aboutUs1">Hello, my name is Lami Beach. I’m 28 years old and originally from Phoenix,  Arizona. Before I transitioned into programming I was involved in just about everything film. My main focus was screenwriting. I’ve worked on movie sets, television sets, and also have written eight screenplays. Unfortunately, I didn’t take the leap and move to Los Angeles because of the cost of  living. So I decided to switch gears and move into programming because of the various opportunities and how lucrative those opportunities are. I picked this specific field because I’ve been a computer junkie my whole life. My dream job is to work with video games. In just about any way, shape, or form. I enjoy them because they give me a sense of freedom.</p>
